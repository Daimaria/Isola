			<h1>ISOLA</h1>
			<p>ISOLA is a turn-based multiplayer board game where your goal is to trap your opponents on a single field. Play against the computer or compete against your friends in this game.</p>
			<p>This game was made as part of a school project. The game ISOLA was not invented but only used and expanded by me.</p>
