				<h3>General</h3>
				<p>
					In this turn-based game your goal is to trap your opponents on a single field and be the last person that can still move.<br/>
					To take part in a game, you have to join a room that still has empty spaces. The game starts when enough players have entered the room. There are two-player and four-player rooms to choose from.<br/>
					To distinguish the different players, they are marked with colors[image]. The player whose turn it is has a stronger color that the others. <br/>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="move" class="tab">
				<h3>Movement</h3>
				<p>
					When your turn starts, you first have to move. You can move to any unoccupied adjacent field, both straight and diagonal. The green Marker shows you wether a field is valid or not. [clip]<br/>
					After you moved your character, you need to remove one field. This can be any unoccupied field across the whole board. The blue marker shows you wether a field is valid or not. [clip]<br/>
					As soon as you removed a field, your turn is over and the next player has to make his/her move.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="win" class="tab">
				<h3>Winning Conditions</h3>
				<p>
					To win, you need to be the last person who is still able to move. If there are two players (in two-player-mode) trapped on three connected fields, the player who removes the unoccupied field wins, since he was the last one to finish a complete turn. [image/clip]
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="room" class="tab">
				<h3>Rooms</h3>
				<p>
					Only ten rooms can exist at the same time. Therefore, if there is no action inside a room for more than five minutes, the room will be shut down to make space for more active rooms. Actions that reset this timer are: a new player joining the room, moving to a field, and removin a field.<br/>
					If you press the "New Game"-button, you can create a new room. You can decide the following settings: Number of total players (2 or 4), number of computer opponents, and the starting position of the computer opponents. [images]
